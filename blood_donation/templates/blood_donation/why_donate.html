Q: Why should I donate blood?</p><br>

<p>A: Safe blood saves lives and improves health. Blood transfusion is needed for:</p
<ul>
<li>women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth;
<li>children with severe anaemia often resulting from malaria or malnutrition;
<li>people with severe trauma following man-made and natural disasters; and
<li>many complex medical and surgical procedures and cancer patients.
<p>It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is used to make products such as clotting factors for people with haemophilia.

<p>There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.</p>

<p>Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.</p>
